% # Context

% ## RTML is used in many disciplines

Real time machine learning (RTML) is used pervasively across disciplines.
%
For example, in climate and environmental monitoring it is used for real-time
flood or wildfire detection from satellite or sensor data, and for predicting
extreme weather events using streaming radar and temperature data.
%
Another example is food delivery where RTML is used for predicting delivery
time based on live traffic, restaurant queues, and historical patterns and
dynamic route planning for drivers and shoppers.

% ## Despite its potential in neuroscience, it has not find many applications

The potential of RTML for neuroscience experimental control is enormous.

Conventional neuroscience data analysis is most often performed offline. An
experiment is performed, experimental data is saved to disk, and later data is
analyzed without time constraints.


A new form of online data analysis if possible, where data is analyzed while it
is being collected, real-time analysis results determine how the experiment
unfolds (e.g., what visual/auditory/odour stimuli to present to experimental
subjects, how to guide neural modulations) and what part of the recorded data
to save and what to discard.
