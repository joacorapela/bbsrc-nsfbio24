Add details about any project partners’ contributions. If there are no project
partners, you can indicate this on the Funding Service.

A project partner is a collaborating organisation who will have an integral
role in the proposed research. This may include direct (cash) or indirect
(in-kind) contributions such as expertise, staff time or use of facilities.
Project partners may be in industry, academia, third sector or government
organisations in the UK or overseas, including partners based in the EU.

If you are applying via the IPA or LINK scheme, please include details of
industry partners here.

If applying under the BBSRC-NSF lead agency scheme, please include details
of your US partner here.

Add the following project partner details:

\begin{itemize}

    \item the organisation name and address (searchable via a drop-down list or enter
the organisation’s details manually, as applicable)

    \item the project partner contact name and email address

    \item the type of contribution (direct or in-direct) and its monetary value
\end{itemize}

If a detail is entered incorrectly and you have saved the entry, remove the
specific project partner record and re-add it with the correct information.

For audit purposes, UKRI requires formal collaboration agreements to be put in
place if an award is made.
