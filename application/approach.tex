How are you going to deliver your proposed work?

What the assessors are looking for in your response

Explain how you have designed your approach so that it:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item is effective and appropriate to achieve your objectives

    \item is feasible, and comprehensively identifies any risks to delivery and
    how they will be managed

    \item uses a clearly written and transparent methodology (if applicable)

    \item summarises the previous work and describes how this will be built
    upon and progressed (if applicable)

    \item will maximise translation of outputs into outcomes and impacts

    \item describes how your, and if applicable your team’s, research
    environment (in terms of the place and relevance to the project) will
    contribute to the success of the work

\end{enumerate}

You may demonstrate elements of your responses in visual form if relevant.

plan for EDI} outlines our commitment to removing barriers to participation in
our programmes, ensuring investments do not inadvertently prevent access or
usage by individuals from minority groups, for example disabled researchers.

To this end, applications should identify how accessibility and inclusiveness
in the widest sense have been incorporated into the design of the project. For
example, you may wish to reference relevant institutional strategies and
policies which support equality, diversity, and inclusion as they relate to
access to equipment and facilities and indicate how the proposed project has
been designed and will be delivered with broad access in mind.
