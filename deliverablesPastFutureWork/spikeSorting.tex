\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item method (and software implementation) for sorting spikes from
    Neuropixels probes in long-duration experiments

    \item software for curation of results of sorting spikes from Neuropixels
    probes in long-duration experiments

    \item quality control measures for the results of sorting spikes from
    Neuropixels probes in long-duration experiments

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Previous work}

\begin{itemize}

    \item methods exist for sorting, curating and quality control spikes from
    short duration experiments

    \item Dr.~Carl Schoonover (AIND) has developed methods to sort spikes from
    long-duration experiments (find out more about these methods)

    \item the SWC has managed to sort spikes from a small subset of channels of
        a Neuropixels probe (how many channels? what duration?)

\end{itemize}
