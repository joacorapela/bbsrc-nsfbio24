What the assessors are looking for in your response

A project partner is a collaborating organisation who will have an integral
role in
the proposed research. This may include direct (cash) or indirect (in-kind)
contributions such as expertise, staff time or use of facilities.

Each statement should:

\begin{itemize}

    \item confirm the partner’s commitment to the project

    \item clearly explain the value, relevance, and possible benefits of the
    work to them

    \item describe any additional value that they bring to the project

\end{itemize}

Ensure you have prior agreement from project partners so that, if you are
offered funding, they will support your project as indicated in the ‘Project
partners’ section.

For audit purposes, UKRI requires formal collaboration agreements to be put in
place if an award is made.

Do not provide a statement of support from host and project co-leads’ research
organisations.

Do not provide a statement of support from collaborators. Contributions from
collaborators not listed as project partners can be outlined in ‘Applicant and
team capability to deliver’.
