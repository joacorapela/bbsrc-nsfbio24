At the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuts and Behavior (SWC) and at
the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU) we are performing a radically
new type of experimentation, that is Naturalistic, Long Duration, and Continual
(NaLoDuCo). We are recording bahavioral and electrophsiological data
continuosly for weeks to months, while mice forage, indidually or socially, in
large naturalistic arenas.

The Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics (AIND) is creating software and hadware
technology to study foraging along two parallel paths. First, they are
investigating the neural basis of foraging behavior in shorter virtual reality
experiments on head fixed mice. Second, they are studying how freely moving
mice learn over extended periods of time, while they spontaneously explore odor
sources.

The SWC/GCNU and the AIND have complementary expertise in foraging research.

Since 2021 the SWC/GCNU have been creating software and hardware infrastructure
to enable NaLoDuCo foraging research, and have successfully used this
technology to perform simultaneous behavioral and neural recordings in mice
foraging in large arenas for weeks to months.
%
Also, the GCNU is a leader in developing advanced neural data analysis methods,
that will be essential to understand data generated by NaLoDuCo experiments.
%
The AIND is performing foraging research, in head-fixed mice using virtual
reality, and in freely moving mice spontaneously exploring odour sources
in long-duration experiments.
%
In addtion, the AIND is a pioneer in generating and openly disseminating
high-quality behavioral and neural datasets at scale.

Here we propose to join forces to co-develop critical NaLoDuCo experimentation
technology, test it thorougly in our three experimental setups (1.\ freely
moving foraging at the SWC/GCNU, 2.\ head-fixed foraging at the AIND, and 3.\
freely moving odour exploration at the AIND), and disseminate it openly to
facilitate the adoption of NaLoDuCo experimentation by research groups around
the world.
