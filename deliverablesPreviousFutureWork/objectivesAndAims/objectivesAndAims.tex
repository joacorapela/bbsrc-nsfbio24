\section{Objectives}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Objectives}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item \textbf{Co-develop a new type of neuroscience experimentation}
            that enables animals to express ethologically relevant behaviours
            over extended periods in naturalistic environments, while capturing
            high-precision behavioural and neural activity measurements.


        \item \textbf{Support research groups worldwide in adopting this new
            experimental framework} by providing comprehensive documentation on
            the hardware and software necessary to implement these experiments.

        \item \textbf{Enable global access to the data generated by these
            experiments} by developing web-based platforms for data access,
            visualisation, and analysis, while also allowing users to conduct
            custom analysis.

    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\section{Specific Aims}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Specific Aims}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item \textbf{Extend the AEON hardware and software infrastructure} to
            support new long-duration experiments, starting with novel
            olfactory learning experiments at AIND.

        \item \textbf{Develop software for neural and behavioural time-series
            visualisation}, enabling continuous and event-aligned views.

        \item \textbf{Design advanced statistical methods} for analysing very
            long-duration and non-stationary time-series.

        \item \textbf{Build real-time machine learning algorithms} to
            enable intelligent neural manipulations.

        \item \textbf{Develop batch and online spike sorting methods} to
            analyse weeks- to month-long continual electrophysiology recordings
            and support real-time machine learning inferences.

    \end{enumerate}

\section{Use Case}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Use Case}

    \only<1>{
        A user begins by \textbf{visualising continuous behavioural measurements},
        such as the kinematics (speed and acceleration) of a mouse during a
        months-long experiment measured by the IMU of an ONIX probe.

        Next, she \textbf{examines the results of a machine learning analysis},
        such as behavioural states inferred by a Switching Hidden Markov Model (SHMM)
        using kinematic data.

        The SHMM was initially trained on the first two hours of the experiment
        and was periodically retrained to \textbf{adapt to non-stationarities},
        such as sensor fluctuations, changes in motivation, fatigue, or learning.
    }

    \only<2>{
        She then \textbf{visualises epoched data}, such as SHMM states aligned to
        key eventsâ€”e.g., the onset of a foraging bout in the richer patch at a
        specific time of day.

        Curious about the neural basis of these SHMM states, she checks the neural
        recordings but realises they have not yet been spike-sorted. She runs our
        \textbf{offline spike sorting method}, developed for very long continuous
        recordings, and performs quality control on its results.

        Based on quality metrics, she detects drift in the recorded signal,
        adjusts the drift correction parameters, and reruns the sorting algorithm.
    }

    \only<3>{
		After examining the sorted spikes from a large neural population,  she
        finds it challenging to interpret activity across so many neurons.  So she
        decides to summarise the population spiking activity by \textbf{estimating
        continuous latent variables}.

        She then returns to the behavioural visualisation software, integrates
        machine learning indices corresponding to these latent variables, and
        \textbf{visualises behavioural data aligned to the newly estimated latents}.
    }

    \only<4>{
        Through these explorations, she hypothesises that a peak in a neural latent
        variable from the prefrontal cortex signals the moment when mice decide
        to begin a foraging bout.

        To test this, she \textbf{runs an online machine learning model} to estimate
        latent variables from prefrontal cortex activity, predicting when this
        peak will occur. She then \textbf{optogenetically inactivates the neural
        population} at the forecasted time.

        Because inactivation prevented the mouse from initiating a foraging bout,
        her hypothesis was supported.
    }

    Notes:

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item for a week-long experiment, the size of the behavioural and neural
            recordings exceeds 200~terabytes. Due to the large datasets sizes,
            we will \textbf{bring users to data}, instead of data to users.
            Data will be stored in the cloud, computation will run on the cloud
            and user computers will only display small data and analysis
            results.

        \item we will \textbf{share data, hardware specifications and
            open-source software openly}.

    \end{enumerate}
