\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item methods to analyse behavioural and electrophysiological recordings
    from NaLoDuCo experiments that are \textbf{online} and \textbf{adaptive to
    non-stationarity} in measurements.

    For behavioural data, we will investigate methods to

    \begin{itemize}

        \item track multiple body parts of animals (deep neural networks)

        \item infer kinematics of foraging mice (linear dynamical systems)

        \item segment behaviour into discrete states

        \item infer the rules that govern mice behaviour from behavioural
        observations only] (i.e., policy inference).

    \end{itemize}

    For neural data, we will investigate methods to:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item track multiple body parts of animals

        \item estimate low-dimensional continual representations of neural
        activity (i.e., latents inference) 

        \item segment neural activity into discrete states

        \item decode environment variables from neural activity

    \end{itemize}

    \item integration of these methods into DANDI, as in Dendro, so that users
    can run them on NaLoDuCo datasets stored in DANDI.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Previous work}

\begin{itemize}

    \item At the Gatsby we have invented several methods for the
        characterisation of neural time
        series~\citep[e.g.,][]{yuEtAl09,dunckerAndSahani18,ruttenEtAl20,yuEtAl24,buesingEtAl12a,buesingEtAl12b,mackeEtAl15,soulatEtAl21,walkerEtAl23,turnerAndSahani14,osheaEtAl22}

    \item \href{https://github.com/magland/dendro}{Dendro} allows to perform
        advanced data analysis on DANDI. It allows to reuse previous analysis.

\end{itemize}
