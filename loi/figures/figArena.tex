    \caption{Foraging Arena (a) and Feeder (b).
    %
    The arena is composed of tessellated hexagonal tiles (a), each featuring a
    newly designed underground feeder (b).
    %
    Pellets are dispensed onto a foraging wheel once the mouse has spun it for
    a pre-defined programmable distance threshold using its forepaws (fictive
    digging).
    %
    The arena contains up to six scale-equipped nesting modules that allows
    housing of mice in the arena and weight monitoring.
    %
    Behavioural monitoring is achieved by an array of high-speed cameras (up to
    15), by which mouse location, mouse identity and body parts can be track in
    real time.
