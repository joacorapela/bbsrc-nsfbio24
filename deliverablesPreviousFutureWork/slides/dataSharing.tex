    \begin{enumerate}

        \item dashboard to convert data collected in NaLoDuCo experiments to the Zarr format, and to upload the Zarr files to DANDI.

        \item dashboard to stream in real time to DANDI data collected from NaLoDuCo experiments

\end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item the AIND is experienced on sharing their recordings on DANDI.
        However, these recordings are not as large as those in NaLoDuCo
        experiments and they are not continual.

\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Future work}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item develop dashboard to convert data collected in NaLoDuCo
            experiments to the Zarr format

        \item develop dashboard to stream in real time data collected from
            NaLoDuCo experiments to DANDI

        \item DANDI is typically used to store neurophysiological datasets much
        smaller than those generated in NaLoDuCo experiments. Conventional
        methods to access data in DANDI may not be fast enough to allow
        performant data visualisation and/or data analysis. We may need to
        explore parallel computing and/or resource efficient cloud
        configurations (i.e., optimise cloud configurations to improve runtime
        performance).
