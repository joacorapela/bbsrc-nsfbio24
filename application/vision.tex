\subsubsection{Context}

Conventional systems neuroscience experiments are typically short in duration
and often place significant constraints on subject behavior to simplify data
analysis.
%
However, these restrictions may limit our ability to observe critical
aspects of brain function and behavior that only manifest in more naturalistic
and extended conditions.

At the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC), we are pioneering Naturalistic,
Long-Duration, and Continual (NaLoDuCo) foraging experiments in mice that span
weeks to months. During these experiments, we collect high-resolution
behavioural and neural recordings in naturalistic settings. In collaboration
with the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU), we are developing novel
analytical methods to interpret this data.

This novel experimental approach will enable researchers to explore neural
mechanisms underlying naturalistic behavior over extended periods for the first
time, offering the possibility of uncovering insights across a wide range of
phenomena, including long-term behavioral adaptation, neural plasticity, and
learning.
%
% The data generated from NaLoDuCo experiments represent an entirely new resource
% in neuroscience, with the potential to drive breakthroughs and discoveries that
% are beyond the reach of traditional experiments.

We aim to empower research centers worldwide to adopt this
groundbreaking approach.
%
However, the scale and complexity of the data generated pose significant
challenges in data acquisition, visualisation, and analysis.
%
In this proposal, we will address these challenges by sharing openly expertise
and software to enable this transformative type of experimentation.

\subsubsection{Focus areas}

Below, we outline the key focus areas we aim to address.
%
Challenges addressing these areas primarily revolve around the collection
and analysis of continuously recorded, extremely large datasets--on the order
of hundreds of terabytes--gathered from experiments spanning weeks to months.

While experiments in neuroscience that are naturalistic, long-duration, or
continuous have been conducted in the past
\citep[e.g.,][]{jhuangEtAl10,maoEtAl21,volohEtAl23}, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to integrate all three of these features in a
single experimental paradigm.
%
This combination introduces unprecedented complexities in data processing, as
we aim to capture behavior and brain activity in their most ecologically valid,
extended, and uninterrupted forms.

The focus areas of the proposed project are (Figure~\ref{fig:focusAreas}):

\begin{description}

    \item[Data Collection \& Management] Efficiently gathering and organizing
        massive datasets over extended periods.

    \item[Data Sharing] Providing global access to large-scale datasets.

    \item[Data Visualization] Developing efficient web-based tools to visualize
        very large behavioral and neural datasets.

    \item[Spike Sorting] Assigning spikes to neurons reliably and tracking
        individual neurons across long-periods of time in real time.

    \item[Data Analysis] Characterizing behavioral and neural recordings
        (Figure~\ref{fig:dataAnalysis}).

    \item[Inference-Driven Experimentation] Creating a new type of
        experimentation driven by real-time behavioral and neural inferences.

\end{description}

We are a unique team to implement this project.
%
The SWC is a world leader in experimental neuroscience, and the GCNU is an
authority in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Both institutions
share the same building and have been collaborating extensively since 2005.
%
NeuroGEARS Ltd.\ has been a key business partner for the implementation of the
NaLoDuCo experimental framework since the project started in 2021,
%
while Catalyst Neuro has played a pivotal role in developing and operating the
DANDI archive,
%
in collaboration with Dr. Jeremy Magland, an expert in spike sorting, data
visualization, and cloud computing.
