\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item dashboard (or examples of how) to convert data collected in NaLoDuCo experiments to the Zarr format, and to upload the Zarr files to DANDI.

    \item dashboard to stream data collected from NaLoDuCo experiments to DANDI

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Previous work}

\begin{itemize}

    \item the AIND is experienced on sharing their recordings on DANDI.
    However, these recordings are not as large as those in NaLoDuCo experiments
    and they are not continual.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future work}

\begin{itemize}

    \item develop dashboard to convert data collected in NaLoDuCo experiments
    to the Zarr format

    \item develop dashboard to stream data collected from NaLoDuCo experiments
    to DANDI

    \item test dashboards on data from:

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item freely-moving foraging mice (SWC)

        \item head-fixed foraging mice (AIND)

        \item freely-moving odour exploration mice (AIND)

    \end{enumerate}

    \item DANDI is typically used to store neurophysiological datasets much
    smaller than those generated in NaLoDuCo experiments. Conventional methods
    to access data in DANDI may not be fast enough to allow performant data
    visualisation and/or data analysis. We may need to explore parallel
    computing and/or resource efficient cloud configurations (i.e., optimising
    cloud configurations to improve runtime performance).

\end{itemize}
