\subsubsection{Data collection \& management}

We have developed a new platform that allows housing of mice in large arenas
(\textgreater 2m diameter), while manipulating and monitoring their behaviour
at high spatiotemporal resolution \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:arena}, ][]{campagnerEtAl24}.
%
We have openly shared software for supporting data acquistion
\citep{aeonacquisition} and management \citep{aeonmecha} in this
arena.
%
Using this platform we have collected several week long datasets both with
single mouse and multiple mice.

\subsubsection{Data sharing}

The large dataset sizes generated by NaLoDuCo experiments, on the order of
hundreads of terabytes,  make it impractical to distribute data to users, and
require to bring users to data. Fortunately, cloud technologies are now mature
to allows this.
%
We will store data in the Distributed Archives for Neuroscience Data
Integration (DANDI), which uses Amazon S3 buckets, and we will provide software
to visualize and analyze data in Amazon EC2 instances, to avoid costly data
transfers.

\subsubsection{Data visualisation}

Our visualisation tools
need to display very large datasets at different temporal scales, from
milliseconds to weeks and months, and they need to be web based.
%
We will use multi-resolution visualization techniques, which store data at
various resolutions, and use the approriate resolution for each zoom level.
%
Web-based visualisation will be optimized using web workers
\citep{webWorkers}.

\subsubsection{Spike sorting}

Spike sorting is specially challenging in NaLoDuCo experimentation since we
want to track individual neurons of freely moving mice for weeks to months.
%
In addition, we need online spike sorting, to allow experiments driven
by real-time machine learning inference, as described below.

We will evaluate methods for tracking neurons over long periods of time
\citep[e.g.,][]{yuanEtAl24,vanBeestEtAl24} and for online sorting
\citep[e.g.,][]{rutishauserEtAl06,santhanamEtAl04}.

\subsubsection{Data analysis}

The very large size of NaLoDuCo experimental data, the fact that the statistics
of these data change across time, and the requirement for real-time and
close-loop inference create new challenges to conventional machine learning
methods.
%
We will evaluate existing methods targeting the experimental problems
in Figure~\ref{fig:dataAnalysis} and, if necessary, modify them, or create new
ones, to address the previous challenges.

For behavioral data, we will evaluate methods to:

\begin{itemize}

    \item track multiple body parts of
animals \citep[e.g.,][and a switching-linear-dyanamical method using RFIDs that
we will develop]{mathisEtAl18,pereiraEtAl22,bidermanEtAl24},

    \item infer kinematics of foraging mice \citep[e.g.,][]{ldspython,challaEtAl11},

    \item segment behavior into discrete states \citep[e.g.,][and a hierarchical HMM
that we will develop]{wiltschkoEtAl15,hsuAndYttri21},

    \item infer the rules that govern mice behavior from behavioral observations
only (i.e., policy inference) \citep[e.g.,][]{ziebartEtAl08,zhuEtAl23}.

\end{itemize}

For neural data, we will evaluate methods to:

\begin{itemize}

    \item estimate low-dimensional continual representations of
        high-dimensional spiking activity (i.e., latents inference)
        \citep[e.g.,][]{mackeEtAl11,dunckerAndSahani18,pandarinathEtAl18,saniEtAl21},

    \item segment neural activity into discrete states
        \citep[e.g.,][]{chenEtAl09,escolaEtAl11},

    \item decode environment variables from neural activity
        \citep[e.g.,][]{dengEtAl15,kloostermanEtAl14,tampuuEtAl19}.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Inference-driven experimentation}

We call inference-driven experimentation to a type of experimentation driven by
machine learning inferences on neural or behavioral data, where the result of
these inferences can change the experiment in real time.

We will apply inference-driven experimentation to test if patterns of neural
activity are causally related to foraging behaviors.
%
We would first check that a pattern of neural activity always precedes a given
foraging behavior. We would then detect the occurence of the pattern and in
real time optogenetically inactivate the neurons responsible for the pattern.
%
If the behavior dissapears the causality argument would be supported.

For this we will use the Bonsai ecosystem for experimental
control~\citep{bonsai} and online machine learning functionality that we are
adding to Bonsai~\citep{bonsaiML}, funded by a BBSRC award~\citep{bbsrcAward}.
